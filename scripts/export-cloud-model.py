"""Convert the OmniCloudMask weights to the ONNX files the browser runs.

Run once, when the model version changes. It writes vendor/ocm-v4-regnety.onnx
and vendor/ocm-v4-edgenext.onnx, which are committed, because a deployment that
fetched its own weights at build time could quietly change what the mask does
between two deploys of the same tagged plugin.

    python3 scripts/export-cloud-model.py

Needs torch, timm, segmentation_models_pytorch, onnx, onnxruntime and
safetensors. None of them are runtime dependencies of the plugin; the browser
sees only the .onnx files and onnxruntime-web.

Provenance. Code MIT from DPIRD-DMA/OmniCloudMask, weights MIT from the Hugging
Face repo NickWright/OmniCloudMask, model version 4, two smp.Unet models over
timm encoders taking red, green and B8A and writing four classes: clear, thick
cloud, thin cloud, cloud shadow.

The export is checked against the torch model it came from before it is kept. A
conversion that silently differed would move every class boundary in every
delivered layer, and nothing on screen would look wrong.
