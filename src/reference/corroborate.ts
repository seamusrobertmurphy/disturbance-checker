// The index maths says a delta moved. It cannot say why, and a verifier is not
// entitled to assume. This module gathers the registries that answer the why:
// an aerial observer's record of insect and disease damage, and mapped fire
// from three registries with different lags and different borders.
//
// They corroborate; they are never inputs. Nothing here touches a composite, a
// delta, a break or an area. A finding that cites them cites them as separate
// evidence with its own provenance and its own date, which is the whole point
// of triangulating.
//
// Coverage is reported rather than left to be discovered. An empty result from
// a survey that never flew reads exactly like an empty result from a forest
// that was never damaged, and the two mean opposite things. The insect survey
// is United States only; fire is covered in both the United States and Canada
// by different registries.
