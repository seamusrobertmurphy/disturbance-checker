// The closest thing to a cause layer that exists wall to wall. Where LCMS says
// change happened and how fast, LANDFIRE names the agent: its legend carries
// Fire, Clearcut, Harvest, Thinning, Mastication, Other Mechanical, Insects,
// Disease, Weather and Development as distinct classes.
//
// That specificity is why it earns a place alongside LCMS rather than
// replacing it. Two products built by different teams from overlapping inputs
// agreeing on a stand is worth more than either alone, and where they disagree
// the disagreement is the thing to chase.
//
// Conterminous states and Alaska. Products are published per year and the
// service naming carries both the release and the disturbance year, so the
// catalogue is read at runtime rather than a naming convention assumed.
