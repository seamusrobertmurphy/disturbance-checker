// LCMS, the Forest Service Landscape Change Monitoring System.
//
// An annual, wall-to-wall classification of change across the conterminous
// United States, derived from the full Landsat and Sentinel-2 record by a
// method entirely unlike this tool's. That independence is the value. When a
// dNDVI threshold flags a stand and LCMS labels the same year and the same
// ground as fast loss, two unrelated methods agree. When they disagree, the
// disagreement is the finding.
//
// It is a corroborating layer and never an input, for the same reason the fire
// and insect registries are: nothing in the SOP calculation may depend on
// another party's model.
